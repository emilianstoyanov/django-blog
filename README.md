# Python-Blog - Final Project of the course "Python Web Framework" at SoftUni
________________________________________________________


The project is called “Python-blog”. The blog is meant for people who are fans of Python.

Python blog is written on Django/Python/, where PostreSQL is used as data base. You can create an account, log in and log out. 

When you register there is a profile picture by default that can be changed. You can also change your email address and your name from the profile panel.

You can annul your password by receiving an email with a personal link. There is also a section with Python news where you can see the latest news related to Python language.

There is a contact form to reach the admin. There are also links to github, facebook and linkendin profiles of the admin.

When you change your picture, the old one is deleted from the server. When deleting a post, data is also deleted from the server.

A user without registration can read posts but only registered users can write posts and contact the admin.
